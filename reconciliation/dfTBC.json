Now I’ve no selling you can say.we were scared because this disease is related to death. His neighbours did not go outside of the house.He added that people don't want to follow the instruction or don't want to understand the situation sometime. \"We had no problem providing health care. We had no, neither the official way nor any other way. Rather there were some sort of the public who might have been in a hurry. At this time I am free to talk, now i can’t talk.

But they are helpless, where will they go.\"\n\nThe respondent repeatedly refused to have known anything about the pandemic, disease or the virus; much less from any of the sources of information like, neighbours, friends, relatives or TV, Mobile phone or health workers. His strong foundation in religious belief was also evident through this quote. \"I have already told you that I haven't heard about it from any person. If somebody follows the path of Allah, the Qurán speaks (to him), may be then I may hear something. Other than that I don't go asking around or havent heard from anyone either. Is there any Corona, without Allah (his will)? I don't care (what they say) about Corona, whether it is right or wrong.\"","name history":"2022-12-15T16:51:13.000Z Philip Fahn-Lai usrUrcoRcQq4ccfL2\nanxiety\n\n2022-09-27T22:25:00.000Z Philip
