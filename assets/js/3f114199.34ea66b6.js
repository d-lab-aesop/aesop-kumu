In practice, many users treat spreadsheet as equivalent to tables, using rows of horizontally-adjacent cells to represent individual observations, and using columns to represent different dimensions or aspects of an observation. However, since adjacent cells are not linked on a software level, users risk disrupting the structure of the data every time they insert, duplicate, or delete a cell, row, or column.
