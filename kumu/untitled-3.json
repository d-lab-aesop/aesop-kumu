But the patient was too extremely poor and didn't have the money to buy milk. The patient was asking me why he should have milk when no one in his family earns alongside the spendings on medicines. If you look at the condition of the patient's house, he [patient] lives along with his brother in law's family. And so, only one person from the family earns while five of them feed on it. So, you can imagine that achieving the right diet is impossible for them. Moreover, the patient is not educated and so the entire household is run in Rs. 10,000 (USD 121.50) And so when I saw the poverty of the patient's family, I motivated them to be strong at every moment they feel they will give up.

The first report of the lymph node mentioned that she had detected MTB while her culture and UDST reports mentioned negative for TB, which was why she was concerned. So, I called the STS to ask him the same, and he said that this decision to start MDR medicines has been taken by the medical officer at the Civil hospital and not him.

This was for the audit that we [WHP] have each month where we are asked about the number of patient houses we attempted to visit. They check this from the Commcare where we enter 'not responded' under the patient's name and 'attempted' for having tried to visit the patient. When we report the number of patients that responded and those that didn't, we have to tell the reason why they didn't respond. By showing this photo I can tell them that I had visited their home but they weren't available and that's why the visit was unsuccessful. This is a photo of such a challenge when the patient isn't available at their home.
