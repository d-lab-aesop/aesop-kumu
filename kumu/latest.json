He had remarked that in his 65 years of life, he hadn’t taken any medicine and yet he faced this illness. He hadn’t taken any injections nor had visited any doctor in his life and yet he has to face TB at this age. So, at that time I counselled him saying that any person’s immunity reduces after 45 years of age and so they face greater susceptibility to getting infected. I also reassured him that it is good that he doesn’t have any other comorbidities and that this disease will last only 6 months with proper medication unlike diabetes whose medicines have to be consumed for the entire life. This motivates him and gives him strength to face this illness.","connection":"Experience of any prior illnesses (patient) -- Level of concern for personal health","from":"Experience of any prior illnesses (patient)","to":"Level of concern for personal health","type":"opposite","last_modified":"3/20/2023 2:46pm","last_modified_by":"L Fahn-Lai","Needs review":"","auto_batch":"mar_16","care_coordinator_tempmar20":"checked","tb_days_into":"","tb_site_specific":"","tb_phase":"","tb_site":"","tb_onset":"","frequency":1,"region":"GUJ"},{"uid":"rectUnN6mEBLZCqHh","cc_review":"","story_id":"GUJ_MSI_CAR_05_INT_1_STO_9","subject_code":"GUJ_MSI_CAR_05_INT_1","activities":"Living","location":"Urban","edited_story":"From the photo, if you can see that there were some shattered glasses on the road.

I guess it must be a small nail or something that pierced. It was right here. I took a photo right here where it happened. But unfortunately, there wasn’t any mechanic shop nearby and so I had to pull my bike till there. I had to pull it for nearly one kilometer as I was outside patient’s home. It wasn’t difficult to find a mechanic shop as someone or the other on the street can help give directions. I took this photo when I parked my punctured bike at the mechanic’s shop.  This doesn’t happen quite frequently but it happened this time. However, it is quite natural to expect your vehicle to breakdown anytime anywhere. The vehicle doesn’t discriminate whether to breakdown in urban area or rural, it does when it does. It is not stressful for me. It only takes Rs. 50 out of my pocket to get the puncture repaired. That is the normal charge for fixing this.","connection":"Quality of public infrastructure -- Frequency of bike punctures and repairs","from":"Quality of public infrastructure","to":"Frequency of bike punctures and repairs","type":"opposite","last_modified":"3/21/2023 5:39am","last_modified_by":"Sirisha Papineni","Needs review":"","auto_batch":"mar_16","care_coordinator_tempmar20":"checked","tb_days_into":"","tb_site_specific":"","tb_phase":"","tb_site":"","tb_onset":"","frequency":3,"region":"GUJ"},{"uid":"recITPnnTdjnfTouY","cc_review":"","story_id":"GUJ_MSI_CAR_03_INT_1_STO_31","subject_code":"GUJ_MSI_CAR_03_INT_1","activities":"Working","location":"Urban","edited_story":"Generally the STS of Adajan TU doesn't have any work with me but at times when he comes late, at 9.30 A.M at the TU as he travels from far, he would call and ask me to dispense the medicines to certain patients who may have their appointment at 9 A.M.

His mother, an aged woman, wasn’t aware of what HIV was and so didn’t know about it. I had met him at his home for the first time. He hadn’t shared anything much, only that he was a street vendor working for his master. He had told me that he wasn’t working for now and would be resting at his place. But the second time today when I called him, he lied saying he is at home but he wasn’t actually. He then asked me to meet him at a shop right opposite his house. So, when I met him, he shared everything with me that his mother wasn’t aware that he sold chewing tobacco, cigarettes along with drugs at that shop! His mother also didn’t know about this. It was appalling to see how confident he felt to share this secret with me when I met him personally in comparison to meeting him at his home.","connection":"prevalence of chronic TB comorbidities -- Level of patient comfort in sharing personal information","from":"prevalence of chronic TB comorbidities","to":"Level of patient comfort in sharing personal information","type":"opposite","last_modified":"3/21/2023 1:08pm","last_modified_by":"Sirisha Papineni","Needs review":"","auto_batch":"mar_16","care_coordinator_tempmar20":"checked","tb_days_into":"","tb_site_specific":"","tb_phase":"","tb_site":"","tb_onset":"","frequency":1,"region":"GUJ"},{"uid":"recZ4GZwAvdVDVTjm","cc_review":"","story_id":"GUJ_MSI_CAR_06_INT_1_STO_31","subject_code":"GUJ_MSI_CAR_06_INT_1","activities":"Learning","location":"Urban","edited_story":"If I could share an instance, there was an address mentioned ‘Reliance, 312’.

Only one member of the family was earning. I took this photo when I was counselling them about the nutrition intake they should take such as having milk twice a day so that the diet corresponds to the effects of the TB medicines. But the patient was too extremely poor and didn't have the money to buy milk. The patient was asking me why he should have milk when no one in his family earns alongside the spendings on medicines. If you look at the condition of the patient's house, he [patient] lives along with his brother in law's family. And so, only one person from the family earns while five of them feed on it. So, you can imagine that achieving the right diet is impossible for them. Moreover, the patient is not educated and so the entire household is run in Rs. 10,000 (USD 121.50) And so when I saw the poverty of the patient's family, I motivated them to be strong at every moment they feel they will give up. They should feel healthy, go to work and help their family. So, I motivated him [patient] so much that he told me that he felt stronger physically now and that he would try to go to work.

I was visiting a patient for the second time today. The first time when I had met him, he had just learnt that he had HIV along with TB when he got diagnosed. His mother, an aged woman, wasn’t aware of what HIV was and so didn’t know about it. I had met him at his home for the first time. He hadn’t shared anything much, only that he was a street vendor working for his master. He had told me that he wasn’t working for now and would be resting at his place. But the second time today when I called him, he lied saying he is at home but he wasn’t actually. He then asked me to meet him at a shop right opposite his house. So, when I met him, he shared everything with me that his mother wasn’t aware that he sold chewing tobacco, cigarettes along with drugs at that shop! His mother also didn’t know about this. It was appalling to see how confident he felt to share this secret with me when I met him personally in comparison to meeting him at his home.","connection":"prevalence of chronic TB comorbidities -- Level of patient comfort in sharing personal information","from":"prevalence of chronic TB comorbidities","to":"Level of patient comfort in sharing personal information","type":"opposite","last_modified":"3/21/2023 1:08pm","last_modified_by":"Sirisha Papineni","Needs review":"","auto_batch":"mar_16","care_coordinator_tempmar20":"checked","tb_days_into":"","tb_site_specific":"","tb_phase":"","tb_site":"","tb_onset":"","frequency":1,"region":"GUJ"},{"uid":"recZ4GZwAvdVDVTjm","cc_review":"","story_id":"GUJ_MSI_CAR_06_INT_1_STO_31","subject_code":"GUJ_MSI_CAR_06_INT_1","activities":"Learning","location":"Urban","edited_story":"If I could share an instance, there was an address mentioned ‘Reliance, 312’.

Only one member of the family was earning. I took this photo when I was counselling them about the nutrition intake they should take such as having milk twice a day so that the diet corresponds to the effects of the TB medicines. But the patient was too extremely poor and didn't have the money to buy milk. The patient was asking me why he should have milk when no one in his family earns alongside the spendings on medicines. If you look at the condition of the patient's house, he [patient] lives along with his brother in law's family. And so, only one person from the family earns while five of them feed on it. So, you can imagine that achieving the right diet is impossible for them. Moreover, the patient is not educated and so the entire household is run in Rs. 10,000 (USD 121.50) And so when I saw the poverty of the patient's family, I motivated them to be strong at every moment they feel they will give up. They should feel healthy, go to work and help their family. So, I motivated him [patient] so much that he told me that he felt stronger physically now and that he would try to go to work.
