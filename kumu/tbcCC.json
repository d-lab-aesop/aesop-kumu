So, one day I decided to visit her directly since my calls to her weren't going through and also because she was handicapped.

Only one member of the family was earning. I took this photo when I was counselling them about the nutrition intake they should take such as having milk twice a day so that the diet corresponds to the effects of the TB medicines. But the patient was too extremely poor and didn't have the money to buy milk. The patient was asking me why he should have milk when no one in his family earns alongside the spendings on medicines. If you look at the condition of the patient's house, he [patient] lives along with his brother in law's family. And so, only one person from the family earns while five of them feed on it. So, you can imagine that achieving the right diet is impossible for them. Moreover, the patient is not educated and so the entire household is run in Rs. 10,000 (USD 121.50) And so when I saw the poverty of the patient's family, I motivated them to be strong at every moment they feel they will give up. They should feel healthy, go to work and help their family. So, I motivated him [patient] so much that he told me that he felt stronger physically now and that he would try to go to work. Even I liked how motivated he felt.","connection":"Level of poverty -- Ability to comply with nutrition guidelines","last_modified":"3/20/2023 2:45pm","last_modified_by":"L Fahn-Lai","auto_batch":"mar_16","care_coordinator_tempmar20":"checked","frequency":1,"region":"GUJ"},{"from":"Capacity of health system staff","to":"Burden on care coordinator","type":"opposite","uid":"rechf3nYPC1uS5M7a","story_id":"GUJ_MSI_CAR_05_INT_1_STO_8","subject_code":"GUJ_MSI_CAR_05_INT_1","activities":"Working","location":"Urban","edited_story":"The reason why I took this picture is because this box comes in a normal [raw] form and is incomplete.

Whenever there is a demand for more boxes, they ask for us. Like, if 5 patients have been distributed with the boxes, after 2-3 months, the requirement of more boxes for newer patients will be made to us. We then again fold, add label/sticker, install module, charge battery and add medicines to it. This is a support work we do to help the NTEP staff.
